# Step 1

### Problem / Requeriment
Start a new macOS Command Line project using Swift language to create objects of different animals like Dog, Lion, Sheep and Cat. Also, display their sound.
### Goal
Use OOP to solve the problem. Dividing the problem in small pieces and then attack then in different stages. Use protocol and models to implement the requirement.

#### Steps:
- New Swift macOS Command line project.
- Add a protocol that requires an implementation of a method. On our example the func getSound() that returns a String value.
- Add few models that implements the protocol. On our example we have the classes Dog, Lion, Sheep and Cat.
- Implement the protocol on each model.
- On main class create an instance of each model and then print their String return from getSound function.
