# OOP (Object Orientation Paradigm)

## Good practices example chapters:
- Start, creation of protocol and models [Step 1](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-1-good-practices)
- Add baseFood property [Step 2](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-2-good-practices)
- Add a maxAge property [Step 3](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-3-good-practices)
- Create a toString method [Step 4](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-4-good-practices)
- Owner property for pets and also access control [Step 5](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-5-good-practices)

## Bad practices example chapters:
- Start, creation of single model [Step 1](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-1-bad-practices)
- Add baseFood property [Step 2](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-2-bad-practices)
- Add a maxAge property [Step 3](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-3-bad-practices)
- Create a toString method [Step 4](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-4-bad-practices)
- Owner property for pets and also access control [Step 5](https://github.com/ProDigi-Developement/bootcamp/tree/oop/swift-5-bad-practices)

Both codes will run and delivery what is requested. However, the "good" example is more easy to maintain and open to changes without imply need to change everyone or impact on all user cases.
