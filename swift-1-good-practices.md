Steps:
- New Swift macOS Command line project.
- Add a protocol that requires an implementation of a method. On our example the func getSound() that returns a String value.
- Add few models that implements the protocol. On our example we have the classes Dog, Lion, Sheep and Cat.
- Implement the protocol on each model.
- On main class create an instance of each model and then print their String return from getSound function.
